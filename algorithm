Algorithm Psuedocode (so far):
Create cross filters
Check grid on cross filters
Mark all open passages
Check if start or end has more outgoing passages
Trace the line from that point to each passage
Go towards the other end if possible (e.g., down and right) and then go other directions if possible
If not possible to go any directions except one that the line came from, itâ€™s dead end (delete the path)
Check if new quarter has more or less passages than start/end and if any passages in the new quarter are the same as in the start
Follow path algorithm to find the next passage
If passage in start quadrant, go to end by following path algorithm
